To start in project parent directory:

### `npm start`

Starts app in development mode\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Page will reload when you make changes, also displays any lint errors in the console.\

### `npm test`

Launches test runner in interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds app for production to `build` folder.\
Bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
